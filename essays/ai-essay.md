### I. Introduction
  AI is one of the most polarizing topics in today's education system. If you told me a semester ago that we wouldn't just be allowed to use AI in a coding class, but even encouraged, I would've had reservations about its impact on genuine learning and student engagement. I did my best to avoid using AI in this class, but desperate times sometimes called for desperate measures, leading me to fall back on ChatGPT as a crutch. While I did find AI useful at times, there were moments where it would lead me in circles and I would wonder if my time would have been better spent reading documentation, watching videos, or just asking a friend. While AI is a powerful tool in the context of a classroom, I believe it should be used with caution. Our brains get stronger from the weight of not understanding, and AI can lift this weight off our shoulders, making solving a problem far too easy. If someone relies too much on AI, there will be a time where it fails them, and they won't be prepared. It is important to find the balance between using AI to enhance our learning and making it do the work for us.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
Here's how I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
  I had no reason to use AI for the Experience WODs. These WODs were essential building blocks for any in-class WODs, and I found them very helpful to do on my own. 

  2. In-class Practice WODs
  Again, these WODs were ungraded and purely for practice, so there was no incentive to use AI. If I ran into any problems, I would reference the Experience WODs, and the answers would typically become clear. If I didn't finish the WOD, I would treat it as a learning moment for the in-class WOD and review where I went wrong.

  3. In-class WODs
  I rarely had to use AI for the in-class WODs. The Experience and Practice WODs prepared me well enough to avoid using AI. There were couple of times where I had issues with my environment or had a syntax error/typo in my code, and as time wound down I had to quickly ask ChatGPT what was going wrong with my environment or where the syntax errors/typos were.

  4. Essays
  Unfortunately, I got a bit lazy with some of my essays. I would sometimes give ChatGPT a prompt and it would give me a good place to start. Sometimes I would even tell it to finish a sentence that I couldn't find the right ending to. As my work load started getting heavier, my time management skills collapsed, and my sleeping hours got shorter, I used ChatGPT to make things easier for myself. I always felt as if I were missing out on a chance to express my voice. I had a pattern of using ChatGPT on one essay, then not using it on the next for the sake of exercising my voice and creativity.

  5. Final project
  For the final project, I've been relying a bit too much on ChatGPT. I wish I spent more time doing actual research on the backend aspects of Meteor and React. ChatGPT has helped me understand many concepts here, but it has also led me to confusion. I've been finding myself looking elsewhere for help, specifically in the templates, documentation, and my friends who are more experienced with backend concepts.

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial
  I would often use ChatGPT here to clarify a concept. Sometimes I would tell it to explain to me as if I were a kindergartner, and would condense a confusing concept into something more digestible. I think that this is where ChatGPT is at its best, but I still believe that if you can find a more credible source, you should utilize it.

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
  In these cases, I would typically only answer if I knew the answer right away from previous experience. Otherwise, I felt no need to go searching for answers. It was only when Professor Port outright told us to ask ChatGPT a question that I would bite and see what the AI says.

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question
  I followed the same logic here as when answering a question in class or in Discord.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
  

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
