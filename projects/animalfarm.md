In the Spring 2023 semester, I enrolled in EE 205 with Professor Mark Nelson. Throughout the semester, we worked on a C++ Project on CLion in which we created a farm that sheltered animals. Common concepts that I gained significant experience in were Classes, constructors and destructors, singly linked-lists, testing using Boost.Test, virtual functions, method overriding, and inheritance.
