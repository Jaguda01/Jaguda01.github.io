In my senior year at Punahou School, I decided to make a short documentary on the homelessness problem in Hawaii for my senior project. I went to Next Step Shelter in Kakaako and interviewed the people who run the operation. Unfortunately, their services are no longer available, and the location closed down. I also got testimonials from somebody who stayed in the shelter. I filmed, edited, interviewed and produced the project on my own.
