# Flavor Forge

In the Spring 2024 semester, my group of classmates teamed up with the goal of creating a website with budget-friendly recipes for college students. If you want to learn more about the source code and how it works, you can visit our organization's GitHub page at [https://github.com/Flavor-Forge/flavor-forge](https://github.com/Flavor-Forge/flavor-forge).

## Overview

### Home Page

The Flavor Forge homepage is your starting point for culinary exploration. It provides a brief overview of our platform's mission, showcases a featured recipe to inspire your next cooking adventure, and offers easy navigation to other sections of the website.

## My Contributions

- **Recipe Page**: The very first thing that I implemented was a mockup for the recipe page. Here is what it initially looked like when I first got it to work.

- **Navbar**: The next issue that I tackled was the Navbar. At this point we had no way to navigate the page, so it was an essential step towards the functionality of our website.
- **Recipe List Page**: I the implemented the Recipe List Page, which took a bit of time to figure out. Here is a screenshot of the Discord message I sent to Angello Portello, one of my team members, when I finally got it to work.

- **Bug Fixes and Style Changes**: In addition to the two major pages and the navbar, I had many minor contributions to the project in terms of quality control in form of bug fixes and style changes. I also created the testcafe tests to ensure the functionality of our website.

## What I Learned

When working with a team, I learned that leadership and active communication are important aspects of Agile Project Management. When these two elements were absent, the project development became more of a grind than a sprint. Without leadership and communication, issues are assigned on a first come, first served basis, leaving the team members who are more eager to participate to fix most of the issues. Someone with a leadership role, like a project manager, would be able to delegate issues to those who are hesitant to take initiative and pick up new issues. I also learned that when using IDPM as a methodology, it is good practice to frequently push (reasonably) broken code and create a new issue based on that code instead of never pushing your code until it is perfect. In other words, frequent incremental updates are key for IDPM.
