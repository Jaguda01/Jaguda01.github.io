  <h1>My Experience with JavaScript</h1>

  <p>
    Most of my experience in coding is in C and C++. I think JavaScript takes C and makes it more convenient.
    You can write robust algorithms in fewer lines than you’d need in C.
    Having no prior experience with JavaScript, I was nervous to do the WODs, but I finished them with relative ease
    because of how simple the language is compared to C.
  </p>

  <p>
    I honestly haven’t even done the assigned JavaScript tutorials yet because I registered late for the class,
    but the similarities to C are so close that the transition was seamless.
    I think that with enough experience in JavaScript, programs in C can be heavily condensed, making JavaScript a good programming language.
    Maybe after I do the tutorials, my opinions will change, but so far the language feels clean.
  </p>

  <p>
    Athletic software engineering is my preferred method of practice. The WODs act as good puzzles to exercise my coding muscles.
    I am excited to test my coding knowledge and learn more about the cool things that can be done in JavaScript.
